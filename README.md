# Credit_card_fraud_detection
## Project idea: 
companines that involve a lot of transactions with the use of cards need to find anomalies in the system.
The project aims to build a fraud detection model on credit cards
you need to use the transaction and their labels as fraud or non-fraud to detect if new transcations made by the customer are fraud or not
